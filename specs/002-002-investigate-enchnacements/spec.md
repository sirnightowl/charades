# Feature Specification: UX Enhancements - Settings, Background Color, Card Info, Screen Wake Lock

**Feature Branch**: `002-002-investigate-enchnacements`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "002 - investigate enchnacements to user experience - can we change the info button to a settings icon and maybe have the user select a colour for background - default grey as it is. Maybe a small info button on the cards to give their description. Can we also add a keep screen awake - since it'll be a mobile app"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Charades app, I want to customize the app's appearance and have additional features that enhance the gameplay experience. Specifically, I want to change the background color, access card descriptions easily, and ensure the screen stays on during gameplay sessions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is open and user wants to customize settings, **When** the user taps the settings icon, **Then** a settings panel appears allowing background color selection
2. **Given** the user has selected a background color, **When** the user confirms the selection, **Then** the app background changes to the selected color and remembers this preference
3. **Given** a card is displayed with content, **When** the user taps the info button on the card, **Then** additional details about the content are shown to the user
4. **Given** the app is in active use, **When** the user starts a game session, **Then** the screen remains active and does not dim or turn off automatically
5. **Given** the user is in a dark environment, **When** they access the settings, **Then** they can select a background color appropriate for their lighting conditions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user selects a very bright background color in a dark room?
- How does the system handle different screen wake lock permissions across browsers/platforms?
- What happens if the device doesn't support screen wake lock functionality?
- How does the app handle color selection when the user has accessibility settings enabled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST replace the current info button with a settings icon
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select a background color from a predefined palette
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist user's background color preference across sessions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: storage mechanism not specified - local storage, cookies, etc.?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a small info button on content cards
- **FR-005**: System MUST show detailed descriptions when the info button on cards is clicked
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement screen wake lock functionality to keep the display active during gameplay [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should screen wake lock be enabled by default or toggleable?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a default background color of grey when no user preference is set
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain previous functionality while adding new UX features

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Settings**: User preferences including background color choice, screen wake lock preference
- **Color Palette**: Available background color options for user selection
- **Card Info**: Content details displayed when the info button is activated
