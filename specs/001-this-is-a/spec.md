# Feature Specification: Mobile App for Content Catalog

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-is-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This is a semi complete project - I wish to turn it into a android and apple app. Some work has been done but that can be discarded if not needed or we can do it a better way. The information for the movies, books games etc should all go into speerate json files for easy future updating."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to access a mobile application that allows me to browse, discover, and manage information about movies, books, and games. The app should be available on both Android and Apple platforms and should be easily updatable with new content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is installed on an Android or Apple device, **When** the user opens the app, **Then** the user should see a catalog of movies, books, and games that can be browsed and searched.
2. **Given** the user wants to find a specific type of content, **When** the user selects a category (movies, books, or games), **Then** the app should display the relevant content in an organized manner.
3. **Given** new content needs to be added to the app, **When** the content team updates the JSON files, **Then** the app should eventually reflect these changes when updated.
4. **Given** the user is viewing details of a movie/book/game, **When** the user interacts with the content information, **Then** the app should provide all relevant details in an easy-to-read format.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the app is used offline and the content depends on JSON files that aren't cached?
- How does the system handle corrupted or improperly formatted JSON files?
- What happens when the device doesn't have enough storage space for the app and its content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST be available as a native app on both Android and Apple platforms
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide organized access to information about movies, books, and games
- **FR-003**: System MUST support separate JSON files for storing information about movies, books, and games to allow for easy future updating [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update mechanism not specified - real-time updates, app updates, or manual refresh?]
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to browse content by category (movies, books, games)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display detailed information about individual media items
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow searching and filtering of the content catalog
- **FR-007**: System MUST be structured to allow future content additions without major app changes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific extensibility requirements not specified]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle the loading and parsing of separate JSON data files for each content type

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Movie**: Media content entity representing a film, containing attributes like title, director, year, genre, rating, description, cast, etc.
- **Book**: Media content entity representing a literary work, containing attributes like title, author, publication year, genre, rating, description, pages, etc.
- **Game**: Media content entity representing an interactive game, containing attributes like title, developer, platform, year, genre, rating, description, etc.
- **Content Catalog**: The collection of all media items that the user can browse in the application
- **JSON Data Files**: Separate structured data files containing information for each content type (movies.json, books.json, games.json)
