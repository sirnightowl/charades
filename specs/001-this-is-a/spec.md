# Feature Specification: Charades PWA Cleanup and Bug Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-is-a`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "This is a basically complete project just with some quirks. It's a charades app we're preparing for android app and apple as a PWA. However lots of jank remains. look at all these md files etc. Also the settings button doesnt work as if you click the cion it doesnt trigger etc. So take a look at the whole things and discard anything you feel you can improve. The data for the movies, books etc should always be in a stored json file. I don't want to use apis for the moment"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: PWA charades app needs cleanup and bug fixes
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: End users playing charades on mobile devices
   ‚Üí Actions: Click settings button, select categories, view cards
   ‚Üí Data: Movies, books, games, TV shows, songs in JSON files
   ‚Üí Constraints: No external APIs, PWA for Android/iOS, local JSON storage
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Settings button click handler issue
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Excessive documentation files need cleanup
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Data should be in JSON files (already implemented)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
7. Run Review Checklist ‚úì
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users need a fully functional charades game PWA that works smoothly on Android and iOS devices. They should be able to configure app settings through an accessible settings panel, select content categories (movies, TV shows, games, songs, books) to generate random charades cards, and have a clean, distraction-free experience without unnecessary documentation files cluttering the project.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the main app screen, **When** they click the settings icon, **Then** the settings panel must open and display configuration options
2. **Given** the settings panel is open, **When** the user clicks anywhere outside the panel or clicks the close button, **Then** the panel must close properly
3. **Given** a user selects a category (Film, TV Show, Game, Song, or Book), **When** the selection is made, **Then** a random item from that category must be displayed as a charades card
4. **Given** the app is installed as a PWA, **When** a user opens it on Android or iOS, **Then** all features must work without requiring external API calls
5. **Given** a developer views the project repository, **When** they navigate the file structure, **Then** only essential files should be present without redundant documentation files

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the settings icon is clicked rapidly multiple times?
- What happens when JSON data files are missing or contain invalid data?
- How does the app handle offline mode since it's a PWA?
- What happens when a category has no available items?
- What happens when background color or wake lock settings are changed while a card is displayed?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Settings Panel:**
- **FR-001**: System MUST open the settings panel when the settings icon is clicked
- **FR-002**: System MUST close the settings panel when user clicks the close button
- **FR-003**: System MUST close the settings panel when user clicks outside the panel area
- **FR-004**: Settings panel MUST allow users to change background color from a predefined palette
- **FR-005**: Settings panel MUST allow users to toggle screen wake lock during gameplay
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist user settings (background color, wake lock preference) across sessions
- **FR-007**: Settings panel MUST display a "Reset Used Content" button that clears the usage tracking

**Content Display:**
- **FR-008**: System MUST load all content data (movies, TV shows, games, songs, books) from local JSON files
- **FR-009**: System MUST NOT make any external API calls for content data
- **FR-010**: System MUST display a random item when a category button is clicked
- **FR-011**: Each displayed card MUST show the item's title, year, and category-specific metadata (director for movies, author for books, etc.)
- **FR-012**: System MUST track which items have been used to avoid repetition until reset

**PWA Functionality:**
- **FR-013**: App MUST function as a Progressive Web App installable on Android devices
- **FR-014**: App MUST function as a Progressive Web App installable on iOS devices
- **FR-015**: App MUST work offline after initial installation
- **FR-016**: App MUST include proper manifest and service worker configuration

**Project Cleanup:**
- **FR-017**: Repository MUST remove redundant documentation files that clutter the project
- **FR-018**: Repository MUST retain only essential documentation (README, if necessary)
- **FR-019**: System MUST maintain clean, organized file structure suitable for deployment

**User Experience:**
- **FR-020**: All interactive elements (buttons, icons) MUST respond to click/touch events properly
- **FR-021**: App MUST provide visual feedback when actions are performed (loading states, transitions)
- **FR-022**: App MUST display appropriate error messages when content fails to load
- **FR-023**: App MUST work on both mobile and desktop viewports

### Key Entities

- **Content Item**: Represents any charades card (movie, TV show, game, song, or book) with attributes like title, year, and category-specific metadata
- **Settings Configuration**: User preferences including background color choice and screen wake lock status
- **Usage Tracker**: Records which content items have been displayed to prevent immediate repetition
- **Category**: Grouping of content items by type (movies, tvshows, games, songs, books)
