# Research for Mobile Content Catalog App

## Decision: PWA vs Native vs Cross-platform
**Decision**: Use Progressive Web App (PWA) approach with core web technologies
**Rationale**: 
- Meets requirement for both Android and Apple platforms with single codebase
- PWA can be installed on both platforms and work offline with service workers
- Cost-effective compared to maintaining separate native apps
- Faster development and deployment cycle
- Can be hosted via HTTPS to meet user requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
1. Native Android and iOS apps: Would require separate codebases, more resources, longer development time
2. Cross-platform solutions (React Native, Flutter): Would still require platform-specific considerations and potentially more complex toolchain
3. Hybrid apps (Cordova/PhoneGap): Older technology, potentially less performant than PWA
4. Responsive web app without PWA features: Would not meet offline requirements

## Decision: Technology Stack
**Decision**: Core PWA stack using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS with service workers and web app manifest
**Rationale**:
- No additional dependencies to learn/maintain
- Direct control over functionality
- Lightweight and performant
- Follows user's preference for PWA approach
- Can be enhanced later with frameworks if needed

**Alternatives considered**:
1. Frameworks like React, Vue, Angular: Would add complexity and dependencies for a simpler app
2. Framework-specific PWA tools: Would tie to specific ecosystem
3. PWA builders like Workbox: Could be added later if needed, starting with vanilla for simplicity

## Decision: Data Storage & Management
**Decision**: JSON files hosted on server with local caching via service worker
**Rationale**:
- Meets user's requirement for separate JSON files for movies, books, games
- Easy to update content without code changes
- Service workers can cache files for offline access
- Simple to implement with vanilla JavaScript

**Alternatives considered**:
1. Backend API with database: Would add complexity and server management
2. Client-side only with static files: Potential storage limitations on devices
3. Local storage or IndexedDB: Would require sync mechanism with server files

## Decision: Architecture & Code Organization
**Decision**: Component-based architecture with vanilla JavaScript modules
**Rationale**:
- Maintains code organization without framework complexity
- Enables code reusability
- Fits with PWA approach
- Easy to understand and maintain

**Alternatives considered**:
1. Framework-based architecture: Would add overhead
2. Single-file approach: Would become unwieldy as app grows
3. Functional approach: Would be harder to organize as components

## Performance & Offline Requirements
**Decision**: Service worker for caching and offline capability
**Rationale**:
- Essential for PWA functionality
- Allows app to work when network is unavailable
- Can cache JSON data files for offline access
- Part of core PWA specification

**Alternatives considered**:
1. Local storage: Limited space, not ideal for large JSON files
2. IndexedDB: More complex than needed for basic caching
3. No offline capability: Would not meet user requirements
